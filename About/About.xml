	<description>Adds moon sugar and skooma. Moon sugar is a somewhat addictive drug that reduces pain and relaxes the mind. It can be created from raw moon sugar cane, which is harvested from a new plant. You can also further refine it into skooma, which greatly increases its effectiveness, whilst also giving the consumer a slight boost of energy, however it eventually leaves them more tired than before.\n\n-Supports Vanilla Achievements Expanded.\n-Includes a patch that adds cooking grade moon sugar if Vanilla Cooking Expanded is enabled, a weaker version of moon sugar used as a condiment.\n-Based on the 'Elder Scrolls' series by Bethesda Game Studios.
